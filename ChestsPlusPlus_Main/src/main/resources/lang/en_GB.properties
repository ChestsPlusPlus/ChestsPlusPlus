# Chests++ Language File (Version 2.8-Release)
# NOTE: This file gets replaced when the plugin launches! If you want to make modifications create a copy first!
# To create a new language file simply create a copy of this file and rename it to your desired choice for example 'en_US.properties'
# It should be located in the 'lang' folder
# Then in config.yml 'language-file: default' would be renamed to 'language-file: en_US'
# To help contribute to the plugin and provide new language files you can create a pull-request at https://github.com/JamesPeters98/ChestsPlusPlus or join our Discord https://discord.gg/YRs3mP5
